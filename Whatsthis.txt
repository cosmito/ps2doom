Is is version 1.0.3.0 of PS2Doom, a port of Doom for the PS2, started by Lukasz Bruun (http://lukasz.dk) and currently maintained by me, cosmito (http://ps2homebrewing.wordpress.com). It also features audio support functions by Jason Yu (http://www.jasonyu.net).

Run PS2Doom.elf using uLaunchELF and make sure you have a doom1.wad, doom.wad, or doom2.wad copied at the same directory as the ps2doom.elf. Memory cards and USB storage devices can be used and also. Currently HD support is not implemented. Put only one .wad at a time since currently no selector is made yet.


Dualshock Joystick mappings:
============================

Left Analog Stick : Move
Cross             : Shift / Run
Square            : o / Previous weapon
Circle            : p / Next weapon
Triangle          : Escape
L1                : n
L2                : y
r1                : Fire
r2                : Space / Open doors

Start             : Enter

Analog Left click : Map
Analog Right click: Brightness (gamma)

Please note: Enter key action (required to menu operations like starting new game) is a bit clumsy for now. For bringing up the menu, use the Cross button but to select items, use the Start button. This will be fixed.

You can use any USB compatible keyboard with the PlayStation2 also.


Source is included. Also a Visual Studio 2005 project just for code browsing (it doesn't compile).
For compiling, get free ps2sdk and gsKit revision 1470 or less. Apply "patch" for gsKit (copy supplied gsInit.c to your gsKit sources, replacing it). Get also SDL for PS2, revision 1384 or less and apply my "patch" (SDL_ps2video.c). If you want to get USB keyboard support, make sure you build SDL with the HAVE_INPUT_DEVICES=1 at the makefile :
\sdl\src\Makefile
# Enable USB keyboard and mouse (100 KB)
HAVE_INPUT_DEVICES=1

Optionaly build 'ps2sdk\ee\debug\' with the supplied font.c at 'font for debug lib\' folder.

  - The Quit option menu now boots back to the OSD PS2 Browser

20/04/2009 - v1.0.2.2
  - Enabled game save/load to memory card (mc0:). Use R1 e R2 buttons to write funny savenames
