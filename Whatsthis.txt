Is is version 1.0.4.1 of PS2Doom, a port of Doom for the PS2, started by Lukasz Bruun (http://lukasz.dk) and currently maintained by me, cosmito (http://ps2homebrewing.wordpress.com). It also features audio support functions by Jason Yu (http://www.jasonyu.net).

Important: Now the savegame filenames stored at the memorycard changed. This means that
your previous saves needs to be renamed at the PS2DOOM memory card folder.
Use uLaunchELF for that (copy the save files to a USB storage device for example,
rename those at your computer - see below, delete those same files at the memory card
and copy the renamed saves from the USB device back to the PS2DOOM memory card folder).
Refer to uLaunchELF documentation for this operations (I won't offer help at this subject).

Until now, the saves follows the scheme for all the WADs : doomsav0.dsg,  doomsav1.dsg,
and so on. For now on, the saves reflect the WAD name:

For doom2.wad savegames, you should use the the naming scheme : doom2sav0.dsg,  doom2sav1.dsg, etc. Similarly for doom1.wad saves, this will be doom1sav0.dsg,  doom1sav1.dsg.

For doom.wad, the filenames should be doomsav0.dsg,  etc. You get the picture (sorry to explain this to detail, but I wanted to keep this clear).


Run PS2Doom.elf using uLaunchELF and make sure you have a doom1.wad, doom.wad, or doom2.wad (note: case sensitive, that is, DOOM1.WAD, DOOM.WAD, DOOM2.WAD, etc will not work) copied at the same directory as the ps2doom.elf. Memory cards and USB storage devices can be used and also. Currently HD support is not implemented. Put only one .wad at a time since currently no selector is made yet.


Dualshock Joystick mappings:
============================

Left Analog Stick  : Move
Right Analog Stick : Strafe
Cross              : Shift / Run
Square             : o / Previous weapon
Circle             : p / Next weapon
Triangle           : Escape
L1                 : n
L2                 : y
R1                 : Fire
R2                 : Space / Open doors

Start              : Enter
Select             : Map

Analog Right click: Brightness (gamma)


Please note: Enter key action (required to menu operations like starting new game) is a bit clumsy for now. For bringing up the menu, use the Cross button but to select items, use the Start button. This will be fixed.

You can use any USB compatible keyboard with the PlayStation2 also.


Source is included. Also a Visual Studio 2005 project just for code browsing (it doesn't compile).
For compiling, get free ps2sdk and gsKit revision 1470 or less. Apply "patch" for gsKit (copy supplied gsInit.c to your gsKit sources, replacing it). Get also SDL for PS2, revision 1384 or less and apply my "patch" (SDL_ps2video.c). If you want to get USB keyboard support, make sure you build SDL with the HAVE_INPUT_DEVICES=1 at the makefile :
\sdl\src\Makefile
# Enable USB keyboard and mouse (100 KB)
HAVE_INPUT_DEVICES=1

Optionaly build 'ps2sdk\ee\debug\' with the supplied font.c at 'font for debug lib\' folder.

History:
========

12/06/2009 - v1.0.4.1
  - Savegame handling for different WAD : Now savegames from doom1 and doom2 and other WADs can happy cohexist at the same memory card

Important: This means that your previous saves needs to be renamed at the PS2DOOM memory
card folder. Use uLaunchELF for that (copy the save files to a USB storage device for
example, rename those at your computer - see below, delete those same files at the memory 
card and copy the renamed saves from the USB device back to the PS2DOOM memory card 
folder). Refer to uLaunchELF documentation for this operations (I won't offer help at 
this subject).

Until now, the saves follows the scheme for all the WADs : doomsav0.dsg,  doomsav1.dsg,
and so on. For now on, the saves reflect the WAD name:

For doom2.wad savegames, you should use the the naming scheme : doom2sav0.dsg,  doom2sav1.dsg, etc. Similarly for doom1.wad saves, this will be doom1sav0.dsg,  doom1sav1.dsg.

For doom.wad, the filenames should be doomsav0.dsg,  etc. You get the picture (sorry to explain this to detail, but I wanted to keep this clear).

  - Should work with the doom2f.wad (I don't own it)
  - Previous/next weapon selection was buggy (some weapons weren't selectable) - fixed
  - Fixed a crash when a lump is not found (doom.wad at "menu slideshow") - original sources bug?
  - Save/load file handle fixed (no more trying to load/save from empty slots)

31/05/2009 - v1.0.4.0
  - Strafe support for right analog stick. Now map button is Select instead of right analog click, using dlanor suggestion as stated over http://psx-scene.com/forums/454723-post22.html.

01/05/2009 - v1.0.3.0
  - Now loads the .wad from current directory. No need to put it at a root of a USB device anymore. As consequence, loads perfectly from memory card.
  - The Quit option menu now boots back to the OSD PS2 Browser

20/04/2009 - v1.0.2.2
  - Enabled game save/load to memory card (mc0:). Use R1 e R2 buttons to write funny savenames
  - Nicer 'debug' font (thanks NoEffex and Allen http://forums.ps2dev.org/viewtopic.php?t=11663)

12/03/2009 - v1.0.2.1
  - No more hicups on sound during screen melt/wipe effect

01/03/2009 - v1.0.2.0
  - Support for USB keyboard (yeah!)
  - Hardwired button mappings to previous/next weapon, gamma correction, run, map view. L1 button now results in 'n' key instead of a 'x' key.
  - If no WAD file found at USB device, warn user.

24/02/2009 - v1.0.1.0
  - Fixes sound from original Lukasz port.
